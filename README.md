# Netflix-vs-Books-Recommendation-system
I was involved in a Summer research project regarding recommendation system under professor Jonathan Lee at Pace university during Summer 2023.
In this project, I have used the cosine similarity algorithm which uses the data of the descriptions (for Netflix) and summaries (for books) to give recommendations. 
I achieved an average cosine similarity score of 0.17 for the Netflix dataset, and got a significantly higher score of 0.24 for the books dataset.
This research proved that the cosine similarity algorithm gives better recommendations for the books data.
